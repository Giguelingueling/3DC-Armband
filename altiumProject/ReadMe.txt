This design is based on a custom ASIC (i.e. SoC). 
The custom ASIC communicated through a SPU bus. It can be replaced within the "NewChip.SchDoc" by any commercial IC using the SPI protocol.
The custom ASIC is entended for utilization in optogenetic experiments requiring simultaneous neural recording, but it can also be used to record many type of biological signals, like EMG.
For sEMG recording, the optogenetic feature (the LED driver connections within the "NewChip.SchDoc" file) can be ignored as it is not required.
